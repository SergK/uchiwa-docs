# Uchiwa: A simple dashboard for the [Sensu](http://sensuapp.org/) monitoring framework

Uchiwa takes the results returned by one or multiple Sensu API and display these in a pleasing way to the eye so you can use Sensu to its full potential.

The dashboard is composed of a [Go web server](https://github.com/sensu/uchiwa), which query every Sensu API and expose the results through its own API to the [AngularJS web interface](https://github.com/sensu/uchiwa-web).

Learn more about Uchiwa by visiting the [project home](https://uchiwa.io).
